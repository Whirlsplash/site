This probably won't come as a surprise to anyone, however, further development
on Whirl has been halted.

Rust and TCP has been quite a pain to work with and I've been exploring other
language candidates. Currently, I'm in the progress of performing a complete
rewrite of Whirl in [Go](https://golang.org/).

What does this mean for Whirl? This will be a considerable setback in terms of
when Whirl will be considered stable. My estimates place Whirl to be stable for
production near Q3 of this year (2021).

Once the Go rewrite is functionally equal to that of the current Rust
implementation, I will be publishing the progress on Whirl's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Whirlsplash/whirl).
